    <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We don’t collect personal data like names, emails, or IP addresses. The only data we process comes from our analytics tool:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Page views</li>
      <li>Referrer URLs</li>
      <li>Device type and browser</li>
      <li>Geographic region (at the country level only)</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">2. Analytics via Plausible</h2>
    <p>
      We use <a href="https://plausible.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plausible Analytics</a>, a GDPR- and CCPA-compliant service that does not use cookies or collect personal identifiers.  
      All metrics are aggregated and anonymous.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">3. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Datomancer itself does not set any cookies. Plausible may set a minimal, first-party cookie only to distinguish unique visitors over time, and it contains no personal data.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">4. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>
      Our posts may include links to external sites. We are not responsible for their privacy practices.  
      Please review their policies separately before interacting.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Plausible retains aggregated analytics for up to 365 days.  
      We do not store or share raw event-level data yourself on our servers.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">6. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement industry-standard measures to protect our site and any data we process through Plausible.  
      However, no system is completely secure—use at your own risk.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Datomancer is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect data from children under 16.  
      If you believe we have, please contact us to have it removed.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.  
      The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect any changes. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.
    </p>
